    "Collect raw EDIFACT CODECO message(s) for HLCU5962669 and extract the serialized eventTime values from the partner feed and corresponding TOS ingestion logs.",
    "Compare serialized eventTime values (partner UTC+0) vs TOS-interpreted timestamps (UTC+8) to confirm the timezone offset and ordering discrepancy.",
    "Correct the affected timestamps in the portal/database for HLCU5962669 so that 'Loaded' is ordered after 'Gate Out', then reprocess or replay the parsed event(s) to update milestone ordering.",
    "Validate portal ordering and customer-facing view for booking BK-O6Q9TJZ7 after correction.",
    "Implement a normalization or ingestion rule to ensure partner eventTime values are timezone-aware or normalized to TOS local UTC+8 at ingest, and add a verification check for EDIFACT CODECO event ordering.",
    "Notify partner Partner-E of the timezone serialization mismatch and confirm they will align future event serialization with agreed timezone formatting.",
    "Monitor for similar mismatches across recent messages and run a targeted sweep for containers with events around the same time window; escalate if further discrepancies found."
