    "If a duplicate advice is found, determine the correct record and either rename/disambiguate the local vessel name or mark the other advice as superseded according to data governance.",
    "After correcting the name or record state, retry creation of the vessel advice and verify success.",
    "Collect and attach evidence (error message, timestamps, request ID/correlation ID, user/client that attempted the action) for audit and triage.",
