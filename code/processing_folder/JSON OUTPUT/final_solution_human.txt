INCIDENT SUMMARY
================================================================================
Module: Vessel (VS)

Summary:
Customer could not create vessel advice for MV Lion City 07; the operation failed with error code VESSEL_ERR_4. The report indicates the local vessel name was already in use by another vessel advice, preventing creation.

Root Cause:
Likely a validation/conflict on the local vessel name (duplicate entry) causing the system to reject creation and return VESSEL_ERR_4.

Resolution Steps:
 - Confirm and record the exact error: VESSEL_ERR_4, timestamp, and any available request ID/correlation ID.
 - Query the vessel-advice records for local vessel name 'MV Lion City 07' to locate existing entries using that name.
 - If a duplicate advice is found, determine the correct record and either rename/disambiguate the local vessel name or mark the other advice as superseded according to data governance.
 - After correcting the name or record state, retry creation of the vessel advice and verify success.
 - Collect and attach evidence (error message, timestamps, request ID/correlation ID, user/client that attempted the action) for audit and triage.
 - If the issue persists after corrective action, escalate to Vessel Duty (see escalation.contact & steps).
