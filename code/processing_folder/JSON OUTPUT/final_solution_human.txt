INCIDENT SUMMARY
================================================================================
Module: EDI/API

Summary:
Time zone serialization drift for partner Partner-E caused eventTime to be serialized in UTC+0 while TOS computed local UTC+8, producing out-of-order milestones for container HLCU5962669 at PSA Keppel. EDIFACT CODECO 'Gate Out' overshadowed a later 'Loaded' event on the portal; booking BK-O6Q9TJZ7 was not operationally impacted but customer view was inconsistent. Investigation and correction required to restore ordering and customer view.

Root Cause:
Time zone serialization mismatch: partner Partner-E events serialized eventTime in UTC+0 while TOS computed/used UTC+8, causing timestamp ordering discrepancies.

Resolution Steps:
 - Contact EDI/API team (Tom Tan) immediately and provide ALR-360601, container HLCU5962669, booking BK-O6Q9TJZ7, and raw EDIFACT CODECO messages.
 - Collect raw EDIFACT CODECO message(s) for HLCU5962669 and extract the serialized eventTime values from the partner feed and corresponding TOS ingestion logs.
 - Compare serialized eventTime values (partner UTC+0) vs TOS-interpreted timestamps (UTC+8) to confirm the timezone offset and ordering discrepancy.
 - Correct the affected timestamps in the portal/database for HLCU5962669 so that 'Loaded' is ordered after 'Gate Out', then reprocess or replay the parsed event(s) to update milestone ordering.
 - Validate portal ordering and customer-facing view for booking BK-O6Q9TJZ7 after correction.
 - Implement a normalization or ingestion rule to ensure partner eventTime values are timezone-aware or normalized to TOS local UTC+8 at ingest, and add a verification check for EDIFACT CODECO event ordering.
 - Notify partner Partner-E of the timezone serialization mismatch and confirm they will align future event serialization with agreed timezone formatting.
 - Monitor for similar mismatches across recent messages and run a targeted sweep for containers with events around the same time window; escalate if further discrepancies found.
