      "Confirm whether an outbound COARRI was ever created for message_ref REF-XYZ-9999 or container TRLU1234567. If not created, investigate event trigger or mapping that produces COARRI and recreate the message.",

      "Validate EDI pipeline health (message queues, workers, ACK/CONTRL ingestion, SFTP/AS2/MQ links). Restart or scale failing workers and clear transient errors per platform runbooks.",
      "If transformation or routing failures caused the missing COARRI, correct the mapping/logic and retransmit the corrected COARRI.",

      "1) Gather context: note container (TRLU1234567), message_ref (REF-XYZ-9999), terminal (Tuas Mega Terminal), expected EDI type (COARRI) and discharge timestamp from source system/event.",
      "2) Search the EDI message store/dashboard for REF-XYZ-9999 and TRLU1234567 to determine if an outbound COARRI was created. Filter by edi_type=COARRI and time range around the discharge event.",
      "3) If no message found: confirm the discharge event reached the message-triggering service (application logs, event bus). Look for errors in the event-to-EDI trigger step. If trigger failed, fix the cause or re-emit the event to regenerate the COARRI.",
      "4) If a message is found: inspect the message status. If status == ERROR and ack_at is missing, follow error handling: review error details/logs, correct payload if needed, then reprocess the message or escalate to EDI engineering if reprocessing fails.",
      "5) If status == PENDING or QUEUED: check worker/consumer health, queue length/backlog, and any recent deployment/incident that could pause delivery. Restart or scale consumers per Ops runbook and monitor until status changes to SENT.",
      "6) If status == SENT but partner ACK not received: verify delivery channel (SFTP/AS2/MQ) logs, confirm partner connection and partner-side processing. Request partner to check for inbound file/ACK and provide timestamps.",
      "7) Check centralized logs for transformation errors (mapping/validation) and system-level alerts (connectivity, disk/queue saturation). Apply fixes or escalate to Platform/Infra on-call.",
      "8) After remediation, confirm a successful COARRI has been delivered and/or ACK/CONTRL received. Record message_id, delivery timestamp, and ACK details.",
      "9) Update case REF-XYZ-9999 with findings, actions taken, and outcome. If root cause is a systemic failure, open a post-incident ticket and notify stakeholders with RCA timeline.",
      "10) If Decision Logic shows NO active message (no message stuck in ERROR with missing ack_at): document that no active errored message exists, proceed to investigate why the COARRI was not created (steps 2â€“3), and escalate if the trigger path is broken or missing."
