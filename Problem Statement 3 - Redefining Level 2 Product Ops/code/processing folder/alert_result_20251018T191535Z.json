    "problem_statement": "EDI detected two COPARN messages for the same container (CMAU1111222) within ~5 minutes — suspected duplicate COPARNs for a CMA booking. Possible causes: duplicate emit from CMA, duplicated ingestion, or deduplication logic/window failure. Need to confirm which COPARN was applied and remediate duplicates so downstream booking/yard state is correct.",
    "solutions": [
      "Verify both COPARN messages in the EDI system and determine their statuses (PROCESSED / ERROR / PENDING) and ack timestamps. If one message is ERROR with no ack_at, trigger manual acknowledgment to complete processing.",
      "If both messages processed and payloads are identical, mark the later message as duplicate (ignore) and ensure booking/container state remains correct. If payloads differ, escalate to Eng and CMA ops for business reconciliation and corrective update to booking/state.",
      "If dedup logic/window failed (e.g., messages within dedup window were not deduplicated), collect logs and metrics, open an engineering incident to fix the dedupe service or configuration, and consider a temporary mitigation (shorten/lengthen window or enable strict dedupe) until fixed.",
      "Notify stakeholders (CMA booking ops, yard ops, and EDI owners) with evidence and actions taken. If required, re-emit the correct COPARN or perform manual reconciliation of the booking record."
    ],
    "sop": [
      "1) Triage & Evidence collection: Search EDI message store for cntr_no = 'CMAU1111222' and edi_type = 'COPARN' for the last 24 hours. Record message IDs, created_at, received_at, status, ack_at, and payload checksums.",
      "2) Compare payloads: If payloads are byte-identical or checksum-identical, treat as a true duplicate. If they differ, capture both payloads and escalate to CMA ops/booking team for business reconciliation.",
      "3) Check statuses and ack timestamps: If a message is stuck in ERROR and ack_at is missing, follow the Resolve the Timeout procedure: manually trigger the acknowledgment process (via EDI admin UI or the manual ack job) and update the message status and ack_at timestamp.",
      "4) Apply dedup decision: - If one message was processed and the second is a duplicate: mark the later message as duplicate in the EDI admin console or set is_duplicate=true in the messages table. - If both processed and caused conflicting state, open a remediation ticket for manual correction of booking/container state and coordinate with CMA ops.",
      "5) Investigate dedup logic: Pull dedupe service logs and configuration (dedupe window, keys used — e.g., container+message-type+carrier). Check for recent deployments or config changes. If dedupe not enforcing expected behavior, escalate to engineering with logs and example message IDs.",
      "6) Short-term mitigation: If incident is recurring, temporarily adjust dedupe window/config or add a guard in the ingestion pipeline to drop obvious duplicates until a permanent fix is deployed.",
      "7) Communicate: Send a summary to stakeholders (what happened, which message was retained, which was dropped/marked duplicate, any changes made) and attach evidence (message IDs, timestamps, payloads, logs).",
      "8) Post-incident: Document root cause and fixes, update runbooks with any new manual steps, and schedule a retrospective with EDI and CMA owners if needed."
