    "problem_statement": "A COPARN submission for container MSCU7654321 at Brani returned an unknown partner error code ERR-UNMAPPED-422 (message_ref REF-NOPE-0000) which is not in our knowledge base, causing the EDI submission to fail and the expected container update/acknowledgement to be missing.",
    "solutions": [
      "Immediate triage: confirm message status in the EDI system and collect full payload, headers, timestamps and partner response for message_ref REF-NOPE-0000.",
      "If the message is stuck in ERROR with no ack_at timestamp, manually trigger the acknowledgement flow (per Resolve the Timeout) to update status and set ack_at so downstream systems are not blocked.",
      "Search internal KB and partner documentation for ERR-UNMAPPED-422 and any equivalent codes; if none found, query recent partner change logs and changelogs for Brani to identify new/renamed codes.",
      "Attempt a controlled resend of the COPARN message after verifying payload correctness and checking for transient partner endpoint issues (rate limits, maintenance windows).",
      "If error persists, escalate to Partner Integration/EDI Engineering with full evidence (payload, HTTP/EDI exchange, timestamps, message_ref, container no.) and request partner-side decoding of ERR-UNMAPPED-422 and remediation.",
      "Create a temporary fallback mapping for unknown 4xx partner error codes (log as partner-unmapped and alert) until partner provides canonical mapping; update monitoring to surface future occurrences automatically.",
      "Document the new error mapping and post-mortem in the KB (include reproduction steps, root cause, fix and contacts) and link the KB entry to the case REF-NOPE-0000."

    "sop": [
      "1) Gather evidence: record container_id (MSCU7654321), message_ref (REF-NOPE-0000), terminal (Brani), timestamp of submission, complete request and response bodies, headers and transport logs. Attach to the case.",
      "2) Check EDI message status: query the EDI messages table/console for REF-NOPE-0000. Note status (ERROR / SENT / ACKED) and presence/absence of ack_at.",
      "3) Decision: If status == ERROR and ack_at is NULL -> follow Resolve the Timeout: manually trigger the acknowledgement flow to set ack_at and transition the message so it no longer blocks downstream processes. Log the action and outcome.",
      "4) If message is not stuck (e.g. SENT but partner returned error), or if manual ack did not resolve: search internal KB and partner-facing docs for ERR-UNMAPPED-422. Include alternate names/codes the partner may use.",
      "5) Reproduce locally (if safe): replay the same payload to the partner sandbox or staging endpoint to verify whether the error is reproducible and collect full protocol traces.",
      "6) Attempt controlled resend: if payload validation issues are suspected and after verifying payload, re-submit COPARN once with monitoring enabled. Do not bulk resend until cause known.",
      "7) Escalate to Partner Integration / EDI Engineering: if the code is unmapped or persists, open an escalation including: case id REF-NOPE-0000, container MSCU7654321, error ERR-UNMAPPED-422, raw exchange, reproduction steps, and timestamp. Request partner decoding of error and remediation plan.",
      "8) Implement temporary mapping/alerting: add ERR-UNMAPPED-422 to an 'unmapped partner errors' log and create an alert rule so future occurrences create high-priority ops tickets until permanent mapping is added.",
      "9) Close loop: once partner confirms meaning and remediation applied, update EDI mapping tables, add KB entry describing the code and fix, update the case notes, and run any necessary reconciliations for the container COPARN state.",
      "10) Post-mortem and preventive actions: record root cause, time-to-detect, time-to-resolve, and add tests (integration tests or contract checks) to catch new/unmapped partner error codes earlier. Notify stakeholders and update runbooks."
