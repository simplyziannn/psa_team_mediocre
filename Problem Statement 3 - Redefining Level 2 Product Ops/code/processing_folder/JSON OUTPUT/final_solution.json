    "Re-run retrieval call for REF-COP-0001 on a safe/test entity using a read-only token; capture status code, latency, and request/correlation ID.",
    "Search callback/webhook delivery logs for REF-COP-0001 and for related endpoints (example: '/edi/upload') for any 4xx/5xx responses noted in alert summaries.",
    "Check API gateway/service health and delivery queue/backlog around the incident window (per owner guidance).",
    "If duplication is confirmed and safe to remediate, apply manual override and reconcile/remove the duplicate while recording the action in the audit trail.",
    "Notify the reporting customer on PORTNET of actions taken and monitor the item for at least 30 minutes for recurrence; attach request/response evidence to the case.",
    "If unresolved after these steps, escalate to Container Product Ops per escalation procedures."
