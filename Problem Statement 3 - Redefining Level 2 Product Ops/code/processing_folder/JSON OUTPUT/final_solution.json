Related alert data shows callback delivery failures for webhook deliveries (example: NYKU8964499 faced 401 due to peer TLS renegotiation on '/edi/upload') and knowledge-base entries describe callback/backlog and idempotency mitigations. DB lookup returned no matches for extracted variables. Immediate verification and log correlation are required to determine whether this is a data duplication, delivery, or presentation issue.",

    "Confirm the duplicate: capture screenshots from PORTNET and export any API responses that show two identical REF-COP-0001 records.",
    "Search service logs and audit trails for REF-COP-0001 across ingestion, processing, and presentation layers; collect request IDs/correlation IDs for relevant timestamps.",
    "Reproduce the container lookup on a safe test entity or staging copy and capture request/response payloads and status codes using a read-only token.",
    "Inspect recent webhook/callback deliveries and callback queue/backlog for related failures (refer to alerts mentioning '/edi/upload' and callback queue growth); record error codes and timestamps.",
    "Check API gateway/service health and upstream delivery logs around the incident window.",
    "Review authentication/permissions for the calling client; if auth errors are observed, refresh/rotate tokens and verify scopes.",
    "If duplicate writes or retries are implicated, ensure idempotency on callbacks and review retry backoff configuration.",
    "Attach collected request/response evidence to the case and observe error rate and correctness for 30 minutes after remediation steps."
