INCIDENT SUMMARY
================================================================================
Module: Container (CNTR)

Summary:
Customer on PORTNET reports duplicate container REF-COP-0001 (two identical entries). Request received (ALR-861600) to investigate and reconcile the container records. No definitive cause provided in inputs; related webhook callback failure examples exist in alert/knowledge matches but no direct mapping to REF-COP-0001 in DB_RESULT.

Root Cause:
unknown

Resolution Steps:
 - Confirm and reproduce the duplicate: query PORTNET and internal datastore for REF-COP-0001; capture timestamps and full records.
 - Inspect audit trail/history for creates/updates of REF-COP-0001 to identify source events.
 - Re-run retrieval call for REF-COP-0001 on a safe/test entity using a read-only token; capture status code, latency, and request/correlation ID.
 - Search callback/webhook delivery logs for REF-COP-0001 and for related endpoints (example: '/edi/upload') for any 4xx/5xx responses noted in alert summaries.
 - Check API gateway/service health and delivery queue/backlog around the incident window (per owner guidance).
 - If duplication is confirmed and safe to remediate, apply manual override and reconcile/remove the duplicate while recording the action in the audit trail.
 - Notify the reporting customer on PORTNET of actions taken and monitor the item for at least 30 minutes for recurrence; attach request/response evidence to the case.
 - If unresolved after these steps, escalate to Container Product Ops per escalation procedures.
