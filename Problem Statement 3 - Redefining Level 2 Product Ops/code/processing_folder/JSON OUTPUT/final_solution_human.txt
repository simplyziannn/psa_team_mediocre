INCIDENT SUMMARY
================================================================================
Module: Vessel (VS)

Summary:
Customer cannot create vessel advice for MV Lion City 07; the create operation failed with error VESSEL_ERR_4. The report states the local vessel name has already been used by another vessel advice entry, preventing creation. Customer requested assistance to resolve the name conflict and complete vessel advice creation.

Root Cause:
Duplicate local vessel name conflict preventing creation (validation error VESSEL_ERR_4)

Resolution Steps:
 - Search the system for existing vessel advice records using the local vessel name 'MV Lion City 07'.
 - If duplicate vessel advice records are found, confirm their status and either archive/rename or remove the obsolete/incorrect record to free the local vessel name.
 - Retry the vessel advice create action for MV Lion City 07 and capture the exact error code, timestamp, and any request/correlation identifiers.
 - If creation succeeds after removing/renaming the duplicate, confirm the customer can proceed and document the change.
 - If the error persists, collect request/response logs and include the captured request/correlation IDs when escalating to Vessel (VS) support.
